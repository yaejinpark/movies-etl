Module 8: ETL - Extract, Transform, Load

## Overview
In this challenge, I was able to demonstrate how to clean large amounts of data from Kaggle and Wikipedia after extraction for loading it into a Postgres database. Extraction involved reading CSV files and converting JSON files into a Pandas DataFrame. Cleaning required utilization of regex and good judgement of when to drop certain parts of data. Loading process was successful after I confirmed that the previous two steps were completed without glaring errors.

## **NOTE**
Due to the size of ratings.csv, I was not able to upload the file in the repo. Please place your own ratings.csv file in the same hierarchy as the Jupyter Notebook files in order to make sure the code works.
